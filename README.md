# myforth-arduino
A simple, non-standard, tethered Forth for the Arduino, includes a steno keyboard application.

I think myforth-arduino is stable now. I have decided to leave "if", "while", and "until" as they are. That is, they do not pop the stack. I've added "if/", "while/", and "until/" which do pop the stack as expected from classic Forth.
